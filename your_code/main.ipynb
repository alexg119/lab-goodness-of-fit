    "## Question 1\n",
    "A researcher gathers information about the patterns of Physical Activity of children in the fifth grade of primary school of a public school. He defines three categories of physical activity (Low, Medium, High). He also inquires about the regular consumption of sugary drinks at school, and defines two categories (Yes = consumed, No = not consumed). We would like to evaluate if there is an association between patterns of physical activity and the consumption of sugary drinks for the children of this school, at a level of 5% significance. The results are in the following table: \n",
